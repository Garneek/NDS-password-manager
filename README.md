# NDS-password-manager
Simple password manager for NDS. Generates password from given master password and short number. Just a quick learning project so i could get used to ndslib.
To use type in 30 symbol main password on keyboard in bottom screen and choose seed number. You should keep same master password and just use different seeds for all your passwords. 

I plan to add these features in the future:
 - some way to save seeds and associate them with name of account they correspond to
 - menu system that allows to change screens from seed choice to password input/output
 - prettier graphics
